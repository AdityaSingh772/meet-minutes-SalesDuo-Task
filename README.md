  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "Team Sync â€“ May 26

- We'll launch the new product on June 10.
- Ravi to prepare onboarding docs by June 5.
- Priya will follow up with logistics team on packaging delay."
```

**Test with file upload:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/process-meeting \
  -F "file=@samples/meeting1.txt"
```

**Test health endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```


### Using Postman
1. **Create a new collection** in Postman called "Meeting Minutes API"
2. **Set up environment variable**: set up the base url to be `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Test health endpoint**:
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/health`
4. **Test raw text processing**:
   - Method: POST  
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/process-meeting`
   - Headers: `Content-Type: text/plain`
   - Body: Select "raw" and paste meeting text
5. **Test file upload**:
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/process-meeting`  
   - Body: Select "form-data", key="file", type="File", select .txt file
6. **Test error handling**:
   - Same as above but with empty body or invalid file

## Sample Output

```json
{
  "summary": "The team confirmed the product launch on June 10, assigned onboarding preparation and logistics follow-up, and discussed user feedback on mobile design.",
  "decisions": [
    "Launch set for June 10",
    "Need mobile-first dashboard for beta users"
  ],
  "actionItems": [
    {
      "task": "Prepare onboarding docs",
      "owner": "Ravi",
      "due": "June 5"
    },
    {
      "task": "Follow up with logistics team",
      "owner": "Priya",
      "due": null
    }
  ]
}
```


## Error Handling

The API handles various error scenarios:
- Empty or missing input (400)
- Invalid file types (400) 
- File size limits (400)
- API key issues (401)
- Rate limiting (429)
- Request timeouts (504)
- Server errors (500)

## Sample Files

Two sample meeting files are included in the `samples/` directory:
- `meeting1.txt` - Product launch team meeting
- `meeting2.txt` - Engineering standup meeting

These demonstrate different meeting formats and complexity levels for testing the AI extraction capabilities.
